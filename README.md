# Caculator-in-MIPS-Assembly-Language
Use keyboard and a 7-segment LED, to build a simple calculator using MIPS Assembly Language. Support the math operations +, -, *, /. 
Since there are no keys on the keyboard, we will use the keyboard:
o Press the a key to enter the calculation +
o Press b to enter the calculation â€“
o Press the c key to enter the calculation *
o Press the d key to enter the calculation /
o Press the f key to enter the spell =

Specific requirements are as follows:
o When pressing the number, because there are only 2 LEDs, only the last 2 numbers are displayed. 
For example when pressing key 1 displays 01. When pressing key 2 displays 12. When pressing more
key 3 then display 23.
o After entering the number, will enter the calculation + - * /
o After pressing the f key (==), calculate and display the result on LED.

Note: Since the problem will have many cases, the basic requirement is to perform the calculation and display on LED. The requirements for catching errors, overflow cases, ... are extensive, not mandatory.
