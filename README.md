# Caculator-in-MIPS-Assembly-Language
Use a keyboard and a 7-segment LED, to build a simple calculator using MIPS Assembly Language. Support the math operations +, -, *, /. 
Since there are no keys on the keyboard, we will use the keyboard: 
o Press 'a' to enter the calculation + 
o Press 'b' to enter the calculation â€“ 
o Press 'c' to enter the calculation * 
o Press 'd'  to enter the calculation / 
o Press 'f' to enter  =

Specific requirements are as follows: 
o When pressing the number, because there are only 2 LEDs, only the last 2 numbers are displayed. For example when pressing key 1 displays 01. When pressing key 2 displays 12. When pressing more key 3 then display 23. 
o After entering the number, will enter the calculation + - * /
 o After pressing 'f' (==), calculate and display the result on the LED.
